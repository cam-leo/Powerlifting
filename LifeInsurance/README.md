# Actuarial Life Insurance and Annuity Calculator

## Project Overview

This repository contains an R-based actuarial calculator for life insurance and annuity products. It demonstrates practical application of actuarial mathematics, life table manipulations, and interactive modeling using R and Shiny.

## Features

- **Life Table Analysis**: Utilizes real-world mortality data to perform actuarial calculations.
- **Present Value Calculations**: Computes expected present values (EPV) for various insurance and annuity products.
- **Interactive Shiny Apps**: Allows users to dynamically adjust parameters and instantly see results.

### Included Calculations:

1. Whole Life Annuities (Due and Immediate)
2. Temporary Life Annuities
3. Whole Life Insurance
4. Term Life Insurance
5. Deferred Life Insurance

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **R Programming**: Extensive use of R for actuarial computations and data manipulation.
- **Shiny Web Applications**: Creation of interactive web apps for actuarial modeling.
- **Actuarial Mathematics**: Implementation of core actuarial concepts including:
  - Mortality rates and life expectancy calculations
  - Survival probabilities
  - Commutation functions
  - Present value calculations for various insurance products

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure you have R and the required packages installed (shiny, etc.)
3. Run the Shiny app:
   ```r
   shiny::runApp("path_to_app_directory")

Future Enhancements

Integration with more diverse mortality tables
Addition of more complex insurance products (e.g., variable annuities)
Implementation of stochastic modeling for interest rates and mortality
