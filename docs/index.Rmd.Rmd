# Cash Flows

## Scenario 1
Suppose you want to go on a trip 5 years from now. You have expenses of 3000 each year for 4 years (including this year), followed by an expense of 4000 and a final expense of 5000. How much would you have to deposit at this moment in time to cover all of
these future payments? Assume a constant interest rate of 2.14% and payments would take place at the beginning of the year.

```{r}
# We have an expense of 3000 from t=0 to t=3, an expense of 4000 at t=4 and 5000 at t=5

# Cash flows
cash_flows <- c(rep(3000,4), 4000, 5000)
                
# Interest Rate
i <- 0.0214

# Discount factor
v <- 1 / (1+i)

# Discount factors
discount_factors <- v ^ (0:5)

# Present value
present_val <- sum(cash_flows * discount_factors)
present_val
```
So you would have to make a deposit of 19800.98 at this current time to cover all of these future payments.

## Scenario 2
You're the head of a lawn mowing company. You want to invest in a new lawn mower than you are confident will generate cash
flows of 50 each month for 3 months, followed by 20 for 2 months. The issue is it costs 185 and you're unsure if it will be a profitable investment. To find out if it is a good investment or not, you must calculate the NPV for this investment. Assume the monthly interest rate is 0.6%.

```{r}
# Define the cash flows
# We have a negative cash flow at t=0 of 500, and 5 positive cash flows of 50 from t=1 to t=5

cash_flows <- c(0, rep(50,3), rep(30,2))

# Discount factors
discount_factors <- (1+0.006) ^ - (0:5)

# NPV
npv <- sum(cash_flows * discount_factors) - 185
npv

```
Since our NPV is positive, this indicates that this would be an overall gain ie profit.

## Scenario 3
Suppose instead of making those expenses, you chose to put them into a savings account. What would be your new present value, assuming same interest rate. What would be your new accumulated value?

```{r}

# Cash flows
cash_flows <- c(rep(3000,4), 4000, 5000)

# Define the discount function 
discount <- function(s, t, i = 0.0214) {
  (1 + i) ^ - (t - s)
}

# Calculate the pv
pv <- sum(cash_flows * discount(0, 0:5))
pv

# Calculate the value at time 6
av <- sum(cash_flows * discount(6, 0:5))

# Calculate the value at time 6, starting from present_value
pv * discount(6, 0)

print(av - pv)
```
As you can see, there would be a difference of $2682.41 if you saved the money instead of spending it.

## Scenario 4
Your parents want to start saving money for your university costs. Each year of study will set you guys back by about 7500. You're currently 14 (t=0) and will start attending when you are 19 (t=5). Therefore, your parents will make 1 deposit each year for 4 years (t=1 to t=4). Assume you will attend for 4 years (t=5 to t=22), the constant annual interest rate is 3.14% and each deposit your parents make is equal. Find the amount of the deposit

```{r}

# discount factors
discount_factors <- (1 + 0.0314) ^ - (0:8)

# deposit pattern
deposits <- c(0, rep(1, 4), rep(0, 4))

# university expenses
payments <- c(rep(0, 5), rep(7500, 4))

# Calculate the present value of the deposits
PV_deposit <- sum(deposits * discount_factors)

# Calculate the present value of the payments
PV_payment <- sum(payments * discount_factors)

# Calculate the yearly deposit K in the first 4 years
yearly_deposit <-  PV_payment / PV_deposit 
yearly_deposit

```
So your parents would have to make a deposit of 6627.546 for each of the 4 years to finance your university.

## Scenario 5
You want to take out a loan to open a new restaurant. You plan to take 1000 this year and 3000 next year. You plan to repay the money with equal yearly payments for the 10 years after next year (t=2 to t=11). Note this time the interest rate isn't constant but changes over time. For the first 3 years it is 4%, then for the next 3 years it is 4.5%, then for the final 5 years it is 6%. How much will your yearly payments be? 

```{r}

# Interest rates
interest <- c(rep(0.04, 3), rep(0.045, 3), rep(0.06, 5))

# Yearly discount factors
yearly_discount_factors <- (1 + interest) ^ (-1)

# Discount factors
discount_factors <- cumprod(c(1, yearly_discount_factors))

# Cash flows for the first two years
cash_flow <- c(1000, 3000)

# Calculate the present value (PV) of the loan
PV_loan <- sum(cash_flow * discount_factors[1:2])

# Calculate the present value (PV) of the repayments
repayment_years <- 2:11
discount_factors_repayments <- discount_factors[repayment_years + 1]
n_payments <- length(discount_factors_repayments)

# Define the yearly payment variable
yearly_payment <- PV_loan / sum(discount_factors_repayments)

# Create the full cash flow vector with the repayments
cash_flow_full <- c(cash_flow, rep(-yearly_payment, n_payments))

# Calculate the PV of the repayments to check the balance
PV_repayments <- sum(cash_flow_full * discount_factors)

# Display the yearly payment and the PV balance check
yearly_payment
PV_repayments
```
Our PV is ~0, meaning the PV of the future payments and PV of your loans are equal, hence the yearly payments would be 515.2757

## Scenario 6
You plan to take out a 100,000 loan with a yearly interest rate of 2.88%. You want to pay back this loan with fixed monthly payments over the next 15 years. Find how much these monthly payments will be.

```{r}

#number of payments
number_payments <- 12*15

#yearly interest rate
i <- 0.0288

#monthly interest rate

monthly_interest <- (1+i)^(1/12)-1

# Define the discount factors
discount_factors <- (1 + monthly_interest) ^ - (1:number_payments)

# Define the payment pattern
payments <- rep(1, number_payments)

# Calculate the monthly loan payment K
K <- 100000 / sum(payments * discount_factors)
K
```
These monthly payments will be 683.0401

# Life Tables

Import the life tables from mortality.org. We are going to import the dataset of Canada from 1921 - 2021.
```{r}
life_table <- read.table("C:\\Users\\megacrazyleo\\Desktop\\SQL\\R\\bltper_1x1.txt", header=FALSE, skip = 3, sep = "") 
colnames(life_table) <- c("Year", "Age", "mx", "qx", "ax", "lx", "dx", "Lx", "Tx", "ex")
```


Setting up variables 
```{r}
year <- life_table$Year

qx <- life_table$qx
mx <- life_table$mx
ax <- life_table$ax
lx <- life_table$lx
dx <- life_table$dx

## Mortality Rates
```{r}
# Setting up the plot
par(xpd = TRUE, mar = c(5, 4, 4, 6) + 0.1) # To ensure plot doesn't cover data

convert_age <- function(x) {
  x[x == "110+"] <- "110"  # Age is character in our dataset, need to change to numeric
  suppressWarnings({
    as.numeric(x)
  })
}
age <- convert_age(age)

# Create a color palette
years <- unique(year)
color_palette <- colorRampPalette(c("blue", "green", "yellow", "red"))(length(years))

# Initialize plot
plot2 <- plot(NULL, 
              xlim = range(age, na.rm = TRUE),  # Exclude NAs from range calculation
              ylim = range(qx, na.rm = TRUE),   # Exclude NAs from range calculation
              main = "Mortality rates (Canada, Males & Females, 1921-2021)",
              xlab = "Age x",
              ylab = expression(paste("Mortality rate ", q[x])),
              type = "l"
)

# Plot each year's data
suppressWarnings({
  for (i in seq_along(years)) {
    year_data <- subset(life_table, Year == years[i])
    lines(year_data$Age, year_data$qx, col = color_palette[i], type = "l")
  }
})

# Colored legend
legend("topright", inset = c(-0.2,0),
       legend = c("1921", "1955", "1988", "2021"),
       col = color_palette[c(1, which.min(abs(years - 1955)), 
                             which.min(abs(years - 1988)), length(years))],
       lty = 1, 
       title = "Year")

```

We can see that mortality rates from recent years are much lower compared to the earliest years. 

## Life Expectancy
```{r}

# Setting up the plot
par(xpd = TRUE, mar = c(5, 4, 4, 6) + 0.1) # To ensure plot doesn't cover data

# Create a color palette
years <- unique(year)
color_palette <- colorRampPalette(c("blue", "green", "yellow", "red"))(length(years))

plot3 <- suppressWarnings({

       xlim = range(age, na.rm = TRUE),  # Exclude NAs from range calculation
       ylim = range(ex, na.rm = TRUE),   # Exclude NAs from range calculation
       main = "Life Expectancy (Canada, Males & Females, 1921-2021)",
       xlab = "Age x",
       ylab = expression(paste("Life Expectancy ", e[x])),
       type = "l"
  )
})

# Plot each year's data
suppressWarnings({
  for (i in seq_along(years)) {
    year_data <- subset(life_table, Year == years[i])

  }
})

# Colored legend
legend("topright", inset = c(-0.2, 0),
       legend = c("1921", "1955", "1988", "2021"),
       col = color_palette[c(1, which.min(abs(years - 1955)), 
                             which.min(abs(years - 1988)), length(years))],
       lty = 1, 
       title = "Year")



```

As we can see, the life expectancy is much higher from the years ~ 2021 as opposed to the years from ~1921 or even ~1955. 
Note for the early years, the life expectancy starts extremely low at age 0 and after a couple years, has a sharp increase. 
This can be explained mainly because it was much more difficult for an infant to survive the initial years. In later years, thanks
to modern medicine, the survival rate of infants have risen much higher.

Let us focus on the year 2021.

## 2021 Life Table
```{r}
life_table <- life_table[year == 2021, ]  #Getting only data from the year 2021
year <- life_table$Year
age <- life_table$Age
qx <- life_table$qx
mx <- life_table$mx
ax <- life_table$ax
lx <- life_table$lx
dx <- life_table$dx
Lx <- life_table$Lx
Tx <- life_table$Tx
ex <- life_table$ex
px <- 1 - qx
```

###Finding the probability that an 23 year old dies before turning 24
```{r}

qx[23 + 1]

```
As we can see, it is a very low probability, < 0.098%

### The expected future lifetime of an 23 year old
```{r}
ex[23 + 1]

```
It is expected that an average 23 year old from Canada will live for 57.06 more years in Canada in 2021


### Plot the mortality rates in the year 2021

```{r}
canada_prob <- lx[100 + 1] / lx[0 + 1]

```
If we compare this with an 18 year old individual
```{r}
canada_prob_2 <- lx[100 + 1] / lx[18 + 1]
