<p>This document is divided into four parts, each focusing on different
aspects of financial and actuarial analysis related to life
insurance:</p>
<p><strong>Cash Flows</strong>: Calculate Present Value (PV), Net
Present Value (NPV), and Accumulated Value (AV) based on cash
transactions.</p>
<p><strong>Life Tables</strong>: Import and analyze survival
probabilities from a mortality dataset.</p>
<p><strong>Life Annuities</strong>: Calculate PV and Expected Present
Value (EPV) of different annuities.</p>
<p><strong>Life Insurance</strong>: Analyze premiums and EPV of various
life insurance products.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to go on a trip 5 years from now. You have expenses
of 3000 each year for 4 years (including this year), followed by an
expense of 4000 and a final expense of 5000. How much would you have to
deposit at this moment in time to cover all of these future payments?
Assume a constant interest rate of 2.14% and payments would take place
at the beginning of the year.</p>

lawn mower than you are confident will generate cash flows of 50 each
month for 3 months, followed by 20 for 2 months. The issue is it costs
185 and you’re unsure if it will be a profitable investment. To find out
if it is a good investment or not, you must calculate the NPV for this
investment. Assume the monthly interest rate is 0.6%.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Yearly Payments</h2>
<p>Your parents want to start saving money for your university costs.
Each year of study will set you guys back by about 7500. You’re
currently 14 (t=0) and will start attending when you are 19 (t=5).
Therefore, your parents will make 1 deposit each year for 4 years (t=1
to t=4). Assume you will attend for 4 years (t=5 to t=22), the constant
annual interest rate is 3.14% and each deposit your parents make is
equal. Find the amount of the deposit</p>

<p>As we can see, the life expectancy is much higher from the years ~
2021 as opposed to the years from ~1921 or even ~1955. Note for the
early years, the life expectancy starts extremely low at age 0 and after
a couple years, has a sharp increase. This can be explained mainly
because it was much more difficult for an infant to survive the initial
years. In later years, thanks to modern medicine, the survival rate of
infants have risen much higher.</p>
<p>Let us focus on the year 2021.</p>
