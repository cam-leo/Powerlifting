# Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my projects portfolio! This repository contains various projects I have completed as part of my journey in mathematics, statistics and data analysis. The two main projects showcased here are focused on life insurance computations using R and powerlifting data analysis using SQL and Python. Additionally, I have included some minor projects, including an analysis of an Exam PA dataset and another R project of a Time Series data analysis.

## Projects

### 1. Life Insurance Data Analysis

**Date:** January 2023  
**Tools:** R

This project involves the computation of present values and the creation of various functions and calculators related to life insurance. The main objectives of this project were to:

- Calculate present values of different life insurance policies.
- Develop functions to automate the computation of insurance values.
- Create calculators for user-friendly interactions.
- Implement Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) for mortality rate predictions.
- Integrate survival models and credibility theory in the analysis.


**Key Features:**

- Detailed analysis of life insurance policies.
- Custom functions for present value calculations.
- Interactive calculators for easy use.
- GLM Implementation for Mortality Rates: Use of logistic regression, probit regression, and complementary log-log regression models to predict mortality rates based on life table data.
- Model Comparison Using AIC: Application of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to compare the fit of different GLM models, ensuring the best model selection for mortality rate predictions.
- Survival Models Integration: Use of Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox Proportional Hazards model to analyze survival probabilities and their impact on life insurance.
- Credibility Theory Application: Adjusted mortality rates using simple credibility models to refine life insurance calculations based on past experiences and new data.
- B端hlmann and B端hlmann-Straub Credibility Models: Implementation of B端hlmann and B端hlmann-Straub credibility models to provide more accurate premium calculations based on past claims data and new observations.

### 2. Powerlifting Data Analysis

**Date:** May 2024  
**Tools:** SQLite, Python, Streamlit

In this project, I analyzed a powerlifting dataset to uncover insights and trends in the data. The project involved using SQL for data manipulation and Python, specifically Streamlit, to create a web app for visualizing the results.

**Key Features:**

- Data cleaning and preprocessing using SQLite.
- Comprehensive data analysis and visualization using Python.
- Streamlit web app for interactive data exploration.

### 3. Exam PA Dataset Analysis

**Tools:** R

This project includes an analysis of a dataset related to Exam PA (Predictive Analytics). The analysis focuses on applying predictive modeling techniques to gain insights from the data.

**Key Features:**

- Data exploration and visualization.
- Application of predictive modeling techniques.
- Interpretation of results and model evaluation.
