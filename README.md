# Actuarial Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my actuarial projects portfolio! This repository contains various projects I have completed as part of my journey in actuarial science and data analysis. The two main projects showcased here are focused on life insurance computations using R and powerlifting data analysis using SQL and Python. Additionally, I have included some minor projects, including an analysis of an Exam PA dataset.

## Projects

### 1. Life Insurance Data Analysis

**Date:** January 2023  
**Tools:** R

This project involves the computation of present values and the creation of various functions and calculators related to life insurance. The main objectives of this project were to:

- Calculate present values of different life insurance policies.
- Develop functions to automate the computation of insurance values.
- Create calculators for user-friendly interactions.

**Key Features:**

- Detailed analysis of life insurance policies.
- Custom functions for present value calculations.
- Interactive calculators for easy use.

### 2. Powerlifting Data Analysis

**Date:** May 2024  
**Tools:** SQLite, Python, Streamlit

In this project, I analyzed a powerlifting dataset to uncover insights and trends in the data. The project involved using SQL for data manipulation and Python, specifically Streamlit, to create a web app for visualizing the results.

**Key Features:**

- Data cleaning and preprocessing using SQLite.
- Comprehensive data analysis and visualization using Python.
- Streamlit web app for interactive data exploration.
