## Projects

### 1. Life Insurance Data Analysis

**Date:** January 2023  
**Tools: R, SQL, Python**

This project involves the computation of present values and the creation of various functions and calculators related to life insurance. The main objectives of this project were to:

- Calculate present values of different life insurance policies.
- Implement Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) for mortality rate predictions.
- Integrate survival models and credibility theory in the analysis.


**Key Features:**

- Detailed analysis of life insurance policies.
- GLM Implementation for Mortality Rates: Use of logistic regression, probit regression, and complementary log-log regression models to predict mortality rates based on life table data.
- Survival Models: Use of Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox Proportional Hazards model to analyze survival probabilities and their impact on life insurance.
- Credibility Theory: Adjusted mortality rates using simple credibility models to refine life insurance calculations based on past experiences and new data.
- Bühlmann-Straub Credibility Models: Implementation of Bühlmann-Straub credibility models to provide more accurate premium calculations based on past claims data and new observations.

### 2. Amazon Stocks Visualization

**Date:** June 2024  
**Tools: Power BI, Tableau, Excel**

Imported and cleaned a dataset containing stock data of Amazon from 1997-2021. I then computed several North Star metrics to determine how well Amazon stock has been performing over the years. Provided several recommendations on which future courses of action to take to continue maximizing company growth.

**Key Features:**

- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Excel.
- Comprehensive data analysis and visualization using Power BI and Tableau.
- Recommendations based on answering of relevant business questions.

### 3. Powerlifting Data Analysis

**Date:** May 2024  
**Tools:** SQLite, Python, Streamlit

In this project, I analyzed a powerlifting dataset to uncover insights and trends in the data. The project involved using SQL for data manipulation and Python, specifically Streamlit, to create a web app for visualizing the results.

**Key Features:**

- Data cleaning and preprocessing using SQLite.
- Comprehensive data analysis and visualization using Python.
- Streamlit web app for interactive data exploration.
